# GithubTraining
Training use of github

This repo is a short, practical guide to help you get started with **Git** and **GitHub**.

🎯 Who This Training Is For
This training is designed for:

Students beginning research projects or starting their PhD
Beginners in data science, bioinformatics, or computational biology
Anyone writing a thesis, paper, or analysis project that evolves over time

⭐ Why Learning Git & GitHub Is Important
Modern research and data work require version control, collaboration, and reproducibility. Git and GitHub help you achieve all three.
🔹 1. Version Control
Git keeps track of every change you make.
No more:

duplicate files
accidental overwrites
lost work
guessing which version is correct

You can always go back in time and recover old versions instantly.
🔹 2. Collaboration Made Easy
GitHub allows you to:

work with supervisors
contribute to team projects
review changes
keep a clean and organized project history

Even a solo researcher benefits because it provides structure, clarity, and backups.
🔹 3. Reproducible Science
Research today must be reproducible—especially in fields like biology, bioinformatics, and data science.
GitHub allows you to document:

code
data steps
scripts
pipeline versions

Anyone can understand what you did, when, and why.
🔹 4. Cloud Backup
Your work is safely stored online.
Laptop crashes or file corruption won’t affect your project.

📚 What You Will Learn
This repo will guide you through:

Creating a GitHub account
Installing Git
Setting up a local repository
Making commits (saving your work with history)
Pushing to GitHub
Branching: how to make different versions without breaking anything
Pull requests (collaborating with others)


🚀 Outcome
By the end of this training, you will be able to:

Use Git confidently for your coursework or research
Track your thesis or research project using GitHub
Collaborate efficiently and professionally
